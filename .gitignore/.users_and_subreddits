## Creating list of number of users in each subreddit
## Adapted from https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/blob/master/subreddit-algebra/processData.sql 
## Thanks to Reddit users /u/Stuck_In_the_Matrix for pulling the data originally and /u/fhoffa for hosting the data on BigQuery
## 22gb data processed
## only measures users active since 2017 - since it only accounts for authors in that period
